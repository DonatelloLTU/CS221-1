------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Needs to be able to handle numbers bigger than BigInteger class
Simple calculations done with large nonnegative numbers
A data structure that represents large numbers array or string
A constructor that uses a string representation of an integer. This may contain leading zeros.
A toString method that will e able to return the string representation of Bigint.
A max method that returns a BigInt and whose value is maximum of val
A min method that returns a BigInt and whose value is minimum of val
A add method that returns a Bigint and whose value is the sum of val
A multiply method that returns a BigInt and whose value is the product of val

A test class to test all of the methods that I have mentioned above

A main class that interacts with the user and allows them to input 2 numbers then the user
	will be asked if they want to see the min,max,add or multiply.
	
	Use copy constructor
	
	Use algorithms in design notes
