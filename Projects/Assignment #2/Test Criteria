---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test the BigInt constructor to make sure that the integer that is being represented as
	a string is initialized.
	 	
	 	You would also need to test to make sure it works with a leading zero and plain zero.
	 	
Would not need to test the toString method since it will be ran everytime the program is used

Test the max method to make sure that it gives the right number and not the smaller number

Test the min method to make sure that it gives the right number and not the bigger number

Test the add method making sure that it added correctly and isnt off by any numbers

Test the multiply method by making sure that the multiplied numbers and correct and not off by
	any numbers
