	JavaPrograms = {strings w : w is syntactically correct Java program}

	AlgebraicExpressions = {w : w is an algebraic expression}

Defining Languages
	
	Grammar
		- States the rules for forming the strings in a language
	
	Benefits of recursive grammars
		- A recognition algorithm determines whether a given string is in the language

Basic of Grammar
 
	- x|y means x or y
	- xy means x followed by y 
	- <word> means any instance of work that the definition defines
	
Java Identifiers
	
	- A Java identifier begins with a letter and is followed by zero or more letters and digits		
	
	- JavaIds = {w : w is a legal Java identifier
	
	- <identifier> = <letter> | <identifier><letter> | <identifier><digit>
	- <letter> = a|b|...|z|A|B|...|Z|_|$
	- <digits> = 0|1|...|9
