Backtracking
	- A strategy for guessing at a solution and backing up when an impasse is reached

Formal definition for JavaPrograms
   +++++++++++++++++++
   |: - such that    |
   |{} - all strings |
   |= - consists of  |
   +++++++++++++++++++
	(The language JavaPrograms consists of all strings w such that w is syntactically correct Java program)
	JavaPrograms = {strings w : w is syntactically correct Java program}

	AlgebraicExpressions = {w : w is an algebraic expression}

Defining Languages
	
	Grammar
		- States the rules for forming the strings in a language
	
	Benefits of recursive grammars
		- A recognition algorithm determines whether a given string is in the language

Basic of Grammar
 
	- x|y means x or y
	- xy means x followed by y 
	- <word> means any instance of work that the definition defines
	
Java Identifiers
	
	- A Java identifier begins with a letter and is followed by zero or more letters and digits		
	
	- JavaIds = {w : w is a legal Java identifier
	
	- <identifier> = <letter> | <identifier><letter> | <identifier><digit>
	- <letter> = a|b|...|z|A|B|...|Z|_|$
	- <digits> = 0|1|...|9
	
	Recognition algorithm
		isId(w)
		if(w is of length 1)
		{
			if(w is a letter)
			{
			return true
			}
			else
			{
			return false
			}
		}
		else if(the last character of w is a letter or a digit)
		{
			return isId(w minus its last character)
		}
		else
		{
			return false
		}
	
Palindromes
	
	- A string that reads the same from left to right as its does from right to left
	- Ex: radar, deed
	- Language
		Palindromes = {w : w reads the same left to right as right to left}
		
	Grammar
		- <pal> = empty string | <ch> | a<pal>a | b <pal> b |...|Z<pal>Z
		- <ch> = a|b|...|z|A|B|...|Z
		
	Recognition algorithm
		isPal(w)
			if(w is the empty string or w is of length 1)
			{
				return true
			}
			else if(w's first and last character are the same letter)
			{
				return isPal(w minus its first and last character)
			}
			else
			{
				return false
			}
